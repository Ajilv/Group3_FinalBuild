So, According to the story your name is Star Lord and you were out somewhere in space on another planet and on the same time your own world was being annexed 
by some enemies of other world.
In the starting you will go through the Introduction level where you just need to see the controls of the game.
Then somehow you gets into the cockpit of your spaceship. Your spaceship was being hijacked and then you start your game. 
There we find enimies guarding the spaceship and waiting for us to arrive.
We need to pick up our guns and kill all of them and collect some quest items and intel items which randomly spawns after their death.
Then we get into other parts of the spaceship. There we just try to evade through the spaceship by killing all the enemies.
After killing all the enemies in ths spaceship
We took our spaceship to our neighbouring planets to find what the actual scene is but there we found that the whole planet is burnt by the enemies and people 
there are running here and there for saving their lives.
Our Spaceship is being acquired by the enemies again at the planet and we need to go home through a portal which was opened by the enemies which is a way to reach
our own planet. 
But we need to cross all the enemies escaping using the health kits and the car present there. We have to take the car and have to reach the portal anyhow and as
soon as we enter the portal we are teleported to our own planet, but here we are surprised to see that oue own planet is also being acquired by those brutal people.
So we need to kill them all and have to make anew world back for the new upcomming generation.
